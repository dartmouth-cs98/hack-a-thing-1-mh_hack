## Blockbreaker
<br/>

## What Did I Attempt To Build
In my hack-a-thing mini project, I attempted to build the retro game "blockbreaker" using Python 2.7 and PyGame. 

## What I Learned
Coding in Python is something I have experience in from CS1, however it has been quite a while since I have had the opportunity to code in this language. Since CS1, I've learned C, Java, MATLAB, Javascript and other coding languages. I'm considering using Python in a future CS project because of its versatility. I also used PyGame, which is an external library used for various multimedia applications.

## What Didn't Work
I was initially going to use the original cs1lib to incorporate the graphics, however I felt that it was more restrictive. I found that Python's simplicity made it easier to work through this project. There were also some graphical difficulties that I ran into while using the PyGame library.

## Other
I used this youtube video to get me started initially.
